# Stuff that is working:
1. Auth is working with sessions, can login and signup.
2. Seperated backend from next.js, using express with node.js-reason is i think this will
   give me a better control over how data flows also i find it somewhat easier to understand as im learning.
3. Database is connected with supabase, I'm using postgresql im just using basic CRUD functionality for now
   need to learn more features of this database.
-----------------------------------------------------;

# Stuff that im working on right now:
1. url scraper, can get title and image from some websites that load up raw html but
   having issues with js loaders, also im not getting price for anything.
2. Need to design a scraper that works consistent across every website.

# Stuff that i will work on:

2. Need to make backend and front work together
3. Figure out security stuff.
